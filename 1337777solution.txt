“absence of truth/reality/actuality/be” comes in two senses : “fool” , for example “the nights repeat twice each day” , and “theft” , for example “I take your orange by attempting to identifying myself as you at the storage and I lie that it is my possession” . Which sense is “I take two of your oranges each day because I say that I will return the same , but then I return one orange each night” ?
